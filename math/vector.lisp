;;;; VECTOR
;; File which provices functions to operate on vectors, stored as

;; Because we sometimes use vectors of integers, we enforce the
;; looser restriction that they are numbers, not just floats
;; because we define '+' and '-', you'll notice we prefix number
;; operations with 'cl:', because they are in the common lisp
;; package
